Project Name: 
NEUROJump

Description: 
NEUROJump models the design of DoodleJump - a player needs to jump on beams in 
order to progress through the game, increase their score, and move through 
levels. In this game, the player needs to pass the signal through the neuron, 
with obstacles generated on the beams in their path, as well as signals bouncing 
throughout the 'neuron'. By reaching the end of the game, the user would have 
'passed' the signal, successfully communicating with the next neuron. 

How to Run The Project: 
- Open up the main.py file (as well as the other files - draw.py, obstacle.py, 
allbeams.py, signals.py)
- run the main.py file (may have to run it a couple of times for it to open 
TopLevelApp)
- Backup code is in Test.py - if the main file crashes, that file should work 
as it has all the code in it

ShortCuts: 
- The game can be rerun (goes back to the signal/level choices page) by pressing
the 'r' key 
- The help screen pops up when the HELP button is pressed on the top right 
or the 'h' key is pressed 
- basic buttons of MAIN PAGE and PLAY help navigate through the pages
